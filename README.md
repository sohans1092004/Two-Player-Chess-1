# Prerequisites 

To run the Two Player Chess game, you need to have the following installed on your system:

• C/GCC Compiler: The game is built using C programming language. It is suggested to use VSCode and after installing the compiler, we need to set its path to environment path variables because it allows the C program to compile from any directory on your computer.

• Raylib: raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming. You can download raylib from the link https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/latest. You can download raylib library from the website https://www.raylib.com/. Notepad++ comes with the downloaded raylib library in which you can get started with two-player-chess.

# Getting Started 
Follow the steps below to get started with the Two Player Chess:

• Clone the repository and copy it to the raylib project directory which you downloaded earlier.

• Open the Project directory using an IDE. For Example: If you are using VSCode, open the folder you downloaded using VSCode.

• Run the Game: Execute the code using Build (F5).

• Game console runs using mouse input.

• Enjoy the game: Play against another human player and have fun!
